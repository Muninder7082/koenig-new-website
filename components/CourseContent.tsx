              In today's fast-paced digital landscape, businesses are constantly seeking ways to innovate, automate, and become more data-driven. The Microsoft Power Platform has emerged as a game-changing suite of tools that empowers organizations to achieve these goals. However, unlocking its full potential isn't as simple as just turning it on. Effective, structured training is the bridge between purchasing a powerful tool and achieving a true return on investment.
            </p>

            <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed mb-6" style={{ color: C.accent }}>
              This article will explore the core components of the Microsoft Power Platform, discuss the tangible risks and tradeoffs of its low-code approach, and explain why formal training is an essential ingredient for success.

            <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed mb-4" style={{ color: "#374151" }}>
              The Microsoft Power Platform is a unified suite of low-code applications and services designed to help users build custom applications, automate workflows, and analyze data with minimal to no traditional coding experience. It is built to work seamlessly with other Microsoft products like Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure, creating a deeply integrated ecosystem for business transformation.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed mb-6" style={{ color: "#374151" }}>
              The platform's primary goal is to empower "citizen developers" — business users with deep process knowledge but little coding background — to create solutions for their own teams, fostering innovation from the ground up.
